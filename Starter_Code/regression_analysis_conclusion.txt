CONCLUSIONS
-----------
Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data as compared to in-sample data?
-----------
Usually RMSE values are ideally low and this shows that the model can predict the data relatively well. The out-of-sample RMSE (0.64) is lower than the in-sample RMSE (0.84) in this case. This shows that the model preformed better with the Out-of-sample data that the model hasn't seen before.
